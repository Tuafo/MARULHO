# Training

This package owns MARULHO model execution, optimization machinery, and
checkpoint serialization. The maintained language path is Transformer-only.

## Active Language Modules

**`language_transformer.py`** — MARULHO's decoder-only causal Transformer
state block. It owns RMSNorm, rotary positions, causal attention, SwiGLU, and
bounded per-layer KV state for incremental decoding.

**`language_model.py`** — the language model contract. It owns:

- `LanguageModelConfig`;
- token embeddings and tied full-vocabulary LM head;
- full-vocabulary next-token cross-entropy;
- greedy generation with repetition and no-repeat controls;
- tensor-indexed stratified fixed-window train/eval splits whose contract hashes
  are computed on CPU before one-way device transfer;
- exact pre-window text-token counts emitted by the split builder, avoiding a
  second full-corpus tokenizer pass in experiment reports;
- chunked host-to-device split transfer whose batch views share large tensor
  storage instead of creating thousands of tiny CUDA allocations;
- a versioned row-major selected-window hash that is independent of batch and
  transfer chunk boundaries;
- CPU-owned immutable split tensors with only the active batch transferred to
  the model device during training or evaluation;
- heldout loss and perplexity;
- atomic Transformer checkpoint save/load.

Generation supports greedy argmax and seeded temperature/top-p nucleus
sampling over the full checkpoint vocabulary. Both use the bounded per-layer
KV state and the same repetition controls; every result reports its exact
policy, temperature, top-p threshold, and seed.

An optional zero-initialized residual output adapter sits after Transformer
hidden state and before the tied language head. Rank zero is the base model.
Adapter experiments may freeze every base parameter and train only the two
bottleneck matrices; zero initialization preserves base logits exactly before
training, and adapter rank/state are checkpoint-owned.

**`checkpointing.py`** — the broader `MarulhoTrainer` checkpoint lifecycle
used by `MarulhoBrain`.

The active language path is `marulho_transformer`; the only accepted
`state_core` value is `transformer`.

## Checkpoint Contract

`marulho_transformer_language_checkpoint.v2` contains:

- exact `LanguageModelConfig`;
- strict model tensor state;
- complete byte or BPE tokenizer state;
- tokenizer vocabulary hash;
- metadata and ownership flags.

The scaling experiment stores optional training-continuation metadata inside
this atomic payload: optimizer/scaler state, cumulative token/step counts, RNG
state, and batch position. Inference loading does not depend on those fields.

The tokenizer vocabulary must exactly match the model vocabulary. Legacy
recurrent, routed, spiking, sampled-vocabulary, and padded-vocabulary
checkpoints are rejected rather than upgraded through compatibility code.

Checkpoint writes use a temporary file, flush and fsync the payload, then
atomically replace the target.

## Runtime Boundaries

- Training code owns model tensors and optimization.
- `MarulhoBrain` owns installation, runtime lifecycle, and durable brain state.
- Evaluation runners may train isolated candidates and write reports.
- Service and UI code do not implement training or mutate model state on reads.
- External pretrained model weights are not part of the language path.

## Retired Language Machinery

The matched BPE pilot selected the Transformer over the dense GRU and earlier
spiking/routed candidates. The following language implementations were deleted:

- selective-spiking and dense-spiking recurrent cores;
- routed experts and route-bank dispatch;
- GRU production state;
- sampled/padded vocabulary training;
- language eligibility traces and recurrent memory slots;
- recurrent continual-learning repair;
- recurrent structural-plasticity transactions;
- their Triton kernels, evaluation runners, and tests.

SNN and column code elsewhere in MARULHO belongs to separate grounded
experiments and must not be reported as the language generator.

## Validation

The minimum focused suite is:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q `
  tests/test_language_transformer.py `
  tests/test_language_tokenizer.py `
  tests/test_language_training_experiment.py `
  tests/test_language_sustained_runtime_evidence.py `
  tests/test_marulho_brain.py
```

Passing tests validate contracts, not language quality. Quality requires a
real-corpus experiment with heldout curves and unseen generation.
