# MARULHO Domain Language

This file is the current vocabulary and decision source of truth. Package-local
`README.md` files describe the machinery that owns each concept. Historical
reports are evidence, not current architecture.

## Project Claim

MARULHO is a local continual-language-system research project. It investigates
whether a MARULHO-owned language cortex, adaptive memory, grounded experience,
and checkpointed online learning can produce a system that is more useful per
local compute budget than a conventional static model.

Current evidence supports a small causal Transformer as the language base.
Current evidence does not support coherent general language, frontier
capability, continual learning, or a superior scaling law.

## Runtime Owners

**MarulhoBrain** — owns the installed language model, tokenizer, generation,
source/tick lifecycle, replay/growth hooks for the separate grounded runtime,
compact traces, and durable checkpoint state.

_Avoid_: generation or durable neural mutation owned by FastAPI, status
projections, the UI, an external LLM, ThoughtLoop, or Cortex.

**Brain Language Runtime** — the adapter that installs one matching Transformer
and tokenizer inside `MarulhoBrain`. Its active path is
`marulho_transformer`. It can generate, serialize, restore, and run bounded
sustained generation.

_Avoid_: compatibility loading for retired recurrent checkpoints, mismatched
tokenizer/model vocabularies, or pretending planned continual memory exists.

**Brain Service Adapter** — the `/brain/*` HTTP and UI adapter. It calls
`MarulhoBrain` and exposes read-only evidence projections. It does not train,
route, replay, select memory, or mutate model state during status reads.

**BrainTrace** — compact runtime telemetry. A trace can show what executed; it
does not prove intelligence or quality.

## Active Language Architecture

**MARULHO Transformer** — the only maintained language state core. It is a
decoder-only causal Transformer implemented in
`src/marulho/training/language_transformer.py`, with:

- RMS normalization;
- rotary positional encoding;
- causal scaled-dot-product attention;
- SwiGLU feed-forward blocks;
- bounded per-layer streaming KV state;
- full-vocabulary logits;
- no external model weights.

The model wrapper and checkpoint contract live in
`src/marulho/training/language_model.py`.

**Checkpoint-Owned Tokenizer** — either the byte tokenizer for small tests or a
BPE tokenizer trained on the selected corpus. The complete vocabulary state and
hash are stored with the checkpoint. Production experiments use BPE.

**Transformer Language Checkpoint v2** — an atomic payload containing the exact
model configuration, model tensors, tokenizer state, tokenizer hash, and
metadata. Legacy recurrent/SNN language checkpoints are intentionally rejected.
Scaling checkpoints additionally persist optimizer/scaler state, cumulative
update counts, RNG state, and batch position in metadata so the maintained
runner can continue one MARULHO-owned arm without rebuilding its tokenizer.
Older v2 checkpoints that predate this state may continue with a fresh
optimizer only when the evidence report says so explicitly.

**Full-Vocabulary Next-Token Learning** — standard causal cross-entropy over the
checkpoint vocabulary. Sampled or padded vocabulary shortcuts are retired until
a matched quality experiment justifies a replacement.

## Quality and Scale

**Base-Language Qualification** — the first promotion boundary. A checkpoint
must show:

- improving heldout loss on a genuinely heldout split;
- coherent multi-sentence continuations on unseen prompts;
- no hidden external model;
- checkpoint save/restore fidelity;
- reproducible configuration and corpus provenance.

Throughput and isolated prompt matches are diagnostic evidence, not substitutes
for this boundary.

**Matched Architecture Experiment** — candidates use the same corpus,
tokenizer, split, model-shape intent, optimizer, token budgets, prompts, and
seed. Parameter counts and observed throughput are reported, but the branch is
selected primarily by heldout quality and unseen generation.

**Local Scaling Law** — a fitted relationship, not a slogan. The initial model
is:

`L(N,D) = E + A/N^alpha + B/D^beta`

where `L` is heldout next-token loss, `N` is non-embedding model parameters,
and `D` is unique or explicitly repeated training tokens. Estimation requires
multiple model sizes, token budgets, and seeds. A two-point loss curve at one
model size is not a scaling law.

The first intended grid is roughly 5M, 20M, and the largest 60-100M-class model
that fits the RTX 3060, each measured at several data/compute budgets. The
objective is to find the local compute-optimal region and a falsifiable
projection before renting larger hardware.

**Frontier Comparison** — a resource-normalized comparison against a strong
conventional baseline at the same task. MARULHO does not claim frontier quality
because a tiny model has high tokens per second. A meaningful win would be, for
example, better retained adaptation or long-context recall than a larger static
baseline under the same VRAM, wall-clock, and data budget.

## Planned Adaptive Architecture

These concepts are hypotheses and must not appear as implemented capabilities.

**Editable Delta-Memory Candidate** — the next base-language competitor. It is
a fixed-size recurrent fast-weight state, not an SNN, PMRM column stack, or
prompt extension. Each token reads the state and updates it through
channel-wise decay plus separately learned erase and write gates. Pure recurrent
and local-attention hybrid variants must share one language/checkpoint contract
and be matched against the Transformer on parameters, tokens, optimizer,
hardware, data order, and evaluations. A PyTorch reference establishes causal
forward/backward truth before fused execution is claimed. The reference now
lives in `src/marulho/training/language_delta.py`; both 20.98M-parameter arms
have full gradient, causal scan/step, generation, and recurrent-state tests but
no quality result or runtime promotion yet.

**Execution-Coupled Structured Memory** — a possible later reasoning organ,
inspired by LCWM's retained markerless role/path evidence and its V10 diagnosis.
Candidate memories or latent programs should earn selection because executing
them improves downstream prediction, not merely because an input was locally
surprising. It is excluded from the base token mixer until the replacement base
model demonstrates coherent unseen language.

**Continual Language Learning** — sequential domain updates from a
quality-qualified base checkpoint, with old-domain, new-domain, and replay
losses measured before and after. The required result is new learning with
bounded forgetting and restored checkpoint fidelity.

**Structural Plasticity** — changing model or memory structure under a
checkpointed transaction. It is paused until a replacement base model beats its
matched fixed-capacity control. No old routed-expert expansion path is
maintained.

## Grounded Subsystem

**Grounded Sparse/Column Runtime** — existing SNN, column, binding, surprise,
and sensorimotor machinery under `src/marulho/core`. It is a separate
experimental substrate, not the language generator and not automatically part
of the future architecture.

**Columns** — candidate units for grounded object/action reference frames or
sparse competition. They are retained only where a grounded experiment can
compare them with a simpler baseline.

**LCO Transfer Experiments** — future tests of persistent identity,
object-action binding, movement/intervention separation, and causal transfer.
Results from another repository are inspiration, not MARULHO evidence until
reproduced here.

**Thousand Brains Theory** — optional scientific inspiration, not a design
constraint. Reference-frame or column mechanisms must win a bounded grounded
task to enter the architecture.

## Evidence Language

**Evidence Artifact** — a JSON report produced by an explicit experiment. It
records inputs, configuration, metrics, ownership flags, and branch decision.
Its existence does not make the decision positive.

**Accepted Run** — the command completed and its invariants held.

**Quality Promotion** — a checkpoint crossed the current quality boundary.
MARULHO has no quality-promoted language checkpoint yet.

**Branch Decision** — one of:

- `scale`: the mechanism wins and merits a larger experiment;
- `redesign`: the hypothesis remains plausible but the implementation or
  experiment is inadequate;
- `retire`: a matched baseline falsifies the maintained path.

**Runtime Truth** — observed execution and state, not configured intent. CUDA,
checkpoint restore, active compute, memory use, and mutation claims require
direct measurements.

## Current Evidence State

The equal-time experiment first selected the 20,976,128-parameter model over
the 62,924,544-parameter model: heldout loss 4.0942 versus 4.6129 after 565.9
versus 560.8 synchronized training seconds. The smaller model processes about
2.43 times more tokens per second on the RTX 3060.

The subsequent unique-data curve trained a fresh 20,976,128-parameter model
with a MARULHO-owned 8,192-token BPE over three provenance-recorded FineWeb-Edu
shards and the same disjoint later-offset holdout:

| Update tokens | Unique | Repeated | Heldout loss | Perplexity | Train time | Tokens/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 16,777,216 | 16,777,216 | 0 | 4.5754 | 97.07 | 232.6 s | 72,125 |
| 33,554,432 | 33,554,432 | 0 | 4.1328 | 62.35 | 462.8 s | 72,498 |
| 50,331,648 | 50,331,648 | 0 | 3.9889 | 54.00 | 693.9 s | 72,531 |

The selected stream contains 57,963,348 BPE tokens, so the final point is 0.87
unique corpus epochs with no repeated update tokens. The loss curve improves,
but the interval gain contracts from 0.4426 to 0.1439. Unseen continuations are
more prompt-related yet still repetitive, sometimes malformed, and causally
incoherent.

The subsequent explicit-record TinyStories diagnostic used the same 21M
architecture, 250,000 official training rows, all 21,990 validation rows, and
50,334,464 unique update tokens:

| Update tokens | Heldout loss | Perplexity | Train time | Tokens/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 16,777,216 | 2.1879 | 8.92 | 251.5 s | 66,698 |
| 33,554,432 | 1.9520 | 7.04 | 500.7 s | 67,013 |
| 50,334,464 | 1.8573 | 6.41 | 748.9 s | 67,210 |

All four unseen story prompts produced grammatical, prompt-conditioned,
multi-sentence continuations. Three emitted EOS before the 192-token cap; one
continued to the cap. The remaining failures are entity drift, object-property
contradiction, role confusion, and incomplete causal closure.

Decision: `keep_transformer_scale_curated_general_curriculum`.

Interpretation: 21M parameters remains the local compute optimum in the tested
range, and the base recipe can learn coherent English. Raw general-web scale and
curriculum quality—not basic Transformer incapacity—are the active blockers.
TinyStories is a restricted diagnostic and does not qualify general language.
The next run must mix structured synthetic textbooks/stories with explicit-
record educational web data, then evaluate the original general prompts.

The first structured-general ablation used 100,000 explicit Cosmopedia v2
records (84,770,600 BPE tokens). At 16,777,216 / 33,554,432 / 50,331,648 update
tokens, heldout loss was 3.7038 / 3.2881 / 3.1318. The final point was 0.82 of
the selected training stream with no repeated selected updates. Grammatical
form improved, but all six unseen continuations hit the 192-token cap and lost
entity, property, or causal state. `cache` became unrelated games or fabric;
the coin/cup relation disappeared. The checkpoint therefore does not promote
general-language quality.

Decision: `continue_21m_on_new_disjoint_structured_documents`.

Interpretation: the improving curve at less than one selected epoch does not
justify retiring the Transformer or promoting the checkpoint. Continue the
same weights on new Cosmopedia records, evaluate against a separate shard that
never trained the checkpoint tokenizer, and preserve fresh-versus-repeated
token accounting. If the longer curve flattens without state consistency,
scale/redesign from that evidence rather than from prose fluency alone.

The document-disjoint continuation restored the 50.33M-token weights/tokenizer,
trained on 150,000 new shard-1 records, and held out 10,000 shard-2 records that
never trained the tokenizer. On this strict holdout, loss moved from 3.1289
before the phase to 2.9863 at 100,663,296 cumulative tokens and 2.7681 at
150,994,944. Both phase points used fresh selected windows. Rain/soil and
server/data adherence improved, but every continuation still hit 192 tokens;
key/box and coin/cup state mutated or vanished, and causal explanations still
degenerated. This remains below Base-Language Qualification.

Decision: `mix_fresh_structured_and_educational_web_data_at_21m`.

The active checkpoint is the 150,994,944-token continuation with exact
optimizer/scaler/RNG/batch-position metadata. Its SHA-256 is
`7fcaa42ed2a32c2c4f2bbba60d632b9a4b78385852a6613141c77372a59998fd`.
Continue these weights on an explicit Cosmopedia/FineWeb-Edu ablation. Do not
add episodic memory merely to compensate for an undertrained base; do not keep
scaling synthetic textbook style if strict loss improves without entity/causal
binding.

The mixed continuation then restored exact AdamW state and trained on 75,000
fresh FineWeb-Edu plus 75,000 fresh Cosmopedia records, with 10,000 disjoint
holdout records from each source. Combined holdout loss moved from 3.6216 before
the phase to 3.4429 at 201,326,592 cumulative tokens and 3.2534 at 251,658,240.
Neither phase point repeated a selected update. Yet entity and causal binding
did not improve: notebook ownership vanished, valve/pump ordering became word
association, and coin/cup state still drifted.

A same-checkpoint decode comparison falsified the simplest alternative
explanation. Seeded temperature-0.8/top-p-0.9 nucleus sampling increased lexical
variety but did not restore prompt relations and often worsened factual drift.
The blocker is not greedy argmax alone.

Decision: `falsify_relation_binding_before_more_generic_pretraining`.

The active checkpoint owns 251,658,240 cumulative update tokens, 61,440
optimizer steps, and exact optimizer/scaler/RNG/batch state. Its SHA-256 is
`25e16893fd6bec4c8f7c858f7fc7bdd969e13fbe733104f4467d7f2f784a7fd3`.
Build a procedural entity/event curriculum with compositionally disjoint
holdouts, continue a branch from this checkpoint, and measure both relation
accuracy and general heldout-loss retention. If the Transformer learns the
relations, redesign curriculum; if it cannot, test PMRM-like episodic binding or
larger capacity against the same benchmark. Do not continue generic token scale
without resolving this branch.

The controlled relation-binding falsification used 200,000 procedural training
documents and 256 compositionally held-out cases. Candidate answers were scored
before the correct index was used for metrics. After 16.78M relation-phase
tokens, total accuracy improved from 47.7% to 87.9%. Container, ownership, and
property accuracy reached 100%; event-order accuracy improved only from 29.7%
to 51.6%.

This is evidence that the 21M Transformer can represent static bindings under a
focused objective. It is not a promotable checkpoint: unchanged mixed-language
loss regressed from 3.2534 to 8.7139, and free generation remained unreliable.
The candidate is rejected for catastrophic forgetting; the 251,658,240-token
mixed checkpoint remains active.

Decision: `relation_learned_but_catastrophic_forgetting_test_replay`.

Next compare a budgeted relation-plus-general replay mixture from the active
base. Require both held-out relation gain and bounded mixed-language loss. If
replay succeeds, continue toward consolidation/replay policies; if it fails,
compare parameter isolation and PMRM-style surprise-selected episodic binding
under equal memory/compute budgets. Event order remains a separate causal
blocker and must not be hidden by perfect static-binding subtasks.

The relation-plus-general replay run used an approximately 20/80 input mixture.
It preserved mixed-language loss (3.2534 to 3.2485) and raised candidate-ranking
accuracy to 98.0%, including 92.2% event order. A subsequent label-safe greedy
audit exposed the remaining gap: exact free-answer accuracy rose from 0% to
44.9%, but ownership reached only 10.9% and container persistence remained 0%.
Property reached 93.8% and event order 75%. Open general prompts also inherited
procedural Q/A template fragments.

Decision: `replay_improves_candidate_ranking_not_free_binding`.

The replay candidate is rejected; the 251,658,240-token mixed checkpoint stays
active. This result motivated the subsequently falsified output-adapter test and
the move to PMRM-style surprise-selected episodic binding under explicit
memory/latency budgets. Do not call multiple-choice accuracy alone relation
competence.

Frozen-base residual output adapters were tested at rank 32 and rank 128, then
removed. Rank 32 used 32,768 trainable parameters and reached 83.2% candidate /
3.1% exact free accuracy. Rank 128 used 131,072 trainable parameters and reached
84.4% / 2.3%. Rank 128 sustained ~151k training tokens/s at ~681 MiB peak
allocated VRAM with only +0.0227 mixed-loss regression, but increasing rank did
not improve free binding and remained far below full replay's 44.9%.

Decision: `retire_output_adapter_test_selective_episodic_binding`.

The adapter architecture, CLI, tests, and local candidates are retired rather
than carried as compatibility debris. The active base remains the
251,658,240-token mixed checkpoint. This decision led to the subsequent prompt-
memory comparison of surprise, random, and recency policies under equal slot,
byte, read, and write budgets.

The first prompt-level PMRM-inspired memory interface was falsified and removed.
With eight distractors and two stored/read episodes, exact free accuracy was
18.4% for no memory, 12.1% random, 5.9% recency, 8.6% surprise, 11.7% full-store
retrieval, and 3.9% for the non-promotable oracle. Surprise required 109.7 s
(2.33 cases/s) versus 72.8 s (3.52 cases/s) for no memory. Even full/oracle
retrieval hurt, so prepending selected text is the rejected interface; this does
not falsify learned hidden-state episodic memory in general.

Decision: `retire_prompt_memory_build_answer_masked_post_training`.

The replay model's 98% candidate ranking versus 44.9% free generation indicates
an objective/interface gap. The answer-masked test restored exact AdamW state
from the active checkpoint and alternated 2,048 relation-answer updates with
2,048 ordinary general-language updates. It processed 10,621,968 tokens, of
which 8,688,968 bore loss, in 312.4 seconds including milestone evaluation at
1,258,403,840 peak allocated CUDA bytes.

Mixed heldout loss moved from 3.2534 to 3.2684, candidate accuracy from 47.7% to
87.1%, and strict free accuracy from 0% to 19.5%. Free container, ownership,
property, and event-order accuracy reached 1.6%, 26.6%, 7.8%, and 42.2%. This
misses the preregistered 60% free-answer threshold and underperforms full
replay's 44.9%, despite bounded scalar loss. The rejected checkpoint and
experiment implementation are deleted; the compact local report is
`reports/language_scaling/answer-masked-post-training-21m-4096-20260710.json`.

Decision: `retire_integrated_pmrm_build_editable_delta_memory_competitor`.

The replacement screen compared pure editable delta memory and local-attention
hybrids with the same 20.98M Transformer. Pure recurrence reached 8.0018 loss at
269,568 tokens; one attention layer improved it to 7.6833; two attention and two
delta layers reached 7.5461 versus Transformer 7.4972. The 2/2 hybrid then
crossed the baseline: 6.9042 versus 7.0625 at 1,057,536 tokens, and 5.6966
versus 5.9962 at 4,199,040 tokens. Its candidate relation accuracy at the last
point was 90.6% versus 73.8%, while strict free generation remained only 0.8%
versus 0%.

The 2/2 hybrid has 20,977,152 parameters and complete gradient coverage. Its
unfused PyTorch reference is about ten times slower than the Transformer, so it
earns durable scaling and unseen-generation testing, not runtime installation
or a replacement claim. The compact finalist report is
`reports/language_scaling/delta-editable-half-finalist-4m-20260710.json`.

Decision: `scale_delta-hybrid-half_and_test_unseen_generation`.

The active checkpoint remains the 251,658,240-token mixed Transformer. The final
corrected integrated PMRM screen trained six fresh matched arms for 269,568
identical scheduled tokens. Every full-memory parameter received a gradient;
surprise, random, and recency each made 576 permanent writes and 13,824 reads.
The Transformer reached general loss 7.4972 at 71,961 training tokens/s and
2.41 GiB peak allocated VRAM. PMRM losses were 7.6701 surprise, 7.6600 random,
7.6571 recency, 7.6999 without memory, and 7.6557 temporal-only. Full PMRM used
about 9.45 GiB and 2,777-2,830 tokens/s. All arms produced 0% exact free
relation answers.

The experiment refutes surprise as the best selector and provides no useful
margin for the full PMRM stack over temporal-only. The Transformer remains both
better and about 26 times faster. No checkpoint was retained; the PMRM model,
runner, and tests are deleted. The compact local report is
`reports/language_scaling/pmrm-integrated-trainable-memory-screening-262k-20260710.json`.

## Retired Language Concepts

The following are not maintained language paths:

- selective-spiking or dense-spiking language recurrence;
- routed language columns/experts;
- dense GRU language state;
- sampled or padded vocabulary training;
- language memory slots from the recurrent checkpoint lineage;
- recurrent-gradient horizons;
- route-bank, column-split, expert, synapse-bundle, or memory-slot structural
  transactions;
- quality-repair sweeps that optimize old prompt gates without solving unseen
  continuation;
- old SNN language readout ledgers as a generation architecture;
- frozen residual output adapters for relation binding.
- prompt-text episodic retrieval by prepending selected episodes.
- answer-masked relation post-training.
- integrated PMRM fixed columns, dual state, episodic selector, and recurrent
  workspace as a base-language architecture.
- token surprise as an assumed memory-utility signal.

Historical reports may mention these terms. New code, status, and documentation
must not present them as active capability.

## Decision Order

1. Clean and validate the Transformer-only runtime.
2. Select 21M as the current compute-optimal size from equal-time evidence.
3. Pass the 21M TinyStories coherence falsification.
4. Retire answer-masked post-training after it preserves scalar loss but fails
   strict free relation generation.
5. Retire integrated PMRM after the corrected equal-budget screen shows no
   base-language advantage and surprise loses to naive selectors.
6. Keep only the 2-delta/2-attention hybrid after it beats the Transformer at
   1.06M and 4.20M tokens; add durable checkpointing and test unseen generation.
7. Use LCWM-style execution-coupled selection only after a base model survives;
   do not make typed synthetic machinery the token mixer.
8. Continue only non-dominated arms through successive halving, then fit the
   first defensible local scaling law only for architectures that
   survive the pilot, using repeated seeds near a branch boundary.
9. Rebuild continual learning, exact resume, and retention measurement.
10. Re-establish sustained 524,288-token generation from the same checkpoint.
11. Add grounded causal experiments, then scale, redesign, or retire.
